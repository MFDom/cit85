<h2>text that is no longer relevant</h2>

<p>This is a paragraph. I wanted to type a paragraph about something cool or something interesting but nothing really comes to mind. I just watched The First Purge movie. I am not really a huge fan of those movies but I watched it none the less.  I can't seem to figure out how they ruled that the first purge was a success right after it finished.  How does that make any sense and how would that be taken so lightly by the people.  Originally, they purge is supposed to have a reason.  It is supposed to cleanse aggression, to be a release for "good" behaviour all year right? So it should have some reason other than just to kill people. It comes out later that the original intention is not what it is but how did they deem the first one a success right after without giving a reason or statistics. But yet they said, "Hey, a bunch of poor people in rural districts who cause trouble died.  Success!!!  What?!?!? Game of thrones last night was good and its going to get better.<del> Oh yes, it will get better, real soon. This text isnt relevant.</del> I should have just wrote this paragraph about Game of Thrones, or maybe even Barry.
